# Progress Log - 2026-02-04

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Project Structure**: Initialized `backend` (FastAPI) and `frontend` (React + Vite).
- **Authentication**: Integrated **Google OAuth 2.0** (Login, Logout, Switch Account).
- **Core Feature**: Implemented `Drive to PDF` conversion (Scan folder -> Download images -> Create PDF).
- **UI/UX**: 
    - Built a modern, Glassmorphism-style interface with Tailwind CSS.
    - Added **Authentication Flow** (Login/Logout buttons).
    - Added **Progress Bar** visualized via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    - Added **Cancel/Stop** button to interrupt processing securely.
    - Implemented Error Handling & Timeout alerts.
- **Advanced OCR Pipeline**:
    - Integrated **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** for high-fidelity text extraction.
    - Implemented **Parallel Batch Processing** (Dynamic partitioning up to 100 concurrent threads for Paid Tier).
    - Added **Streaming Response** to visualize "live" text generation in the UI.
    - Implemented **Copyright/Safety bypass** (Gracefully skip blocked pages instead of crashing).
    - Added **Smart OCR Mode** in Frontend with Gemini API Key management.
    - Implemented **ZIP Output** (Extract text by batch/chapter).

## 🐛 Issues / Challenges
- **Frontend Build**: PostCSS/Tailwind v4 conflict (Solved by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss`).
- **Backend Error**: `cancel_event` missing definition (Solved by importing `threading` properly).
- **Gemini Rate Limits**: Encountered 429 Errors in Free Tier (Solved by reducing concurrency to 5 and adding 20s retry backoff).
- **API Speed**: Gemini 3 Flash can be slow per page (~45s), mitigated by parallel processing.
- **Copyright Filter**: Google API occasionally blocks pages (Finish Reason 4); fixed by adding error handling to skip those chunks.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- **Text Refinement**: Improve chapter detection regex.
- **EPUB Export**: Add feature to convert extracted text into `.epub` format.
- **Deployment**: Prepare Dockerfile for cloud deployment.
